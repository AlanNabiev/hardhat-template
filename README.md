# Etherscan verification

To try out Etherscan verification, you first need to deploy a contract to an Ethereum network that's supported by Etherscan, such as Ropsten.

First deploy contract with command:

```shell
npm run deploy:ropstein
```

Then, copy the deployment address and paste it in to replace `DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` in this command:

```shell
npm run verify:ropstein DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS
```
